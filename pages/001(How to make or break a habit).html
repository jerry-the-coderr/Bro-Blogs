    <h2>How to Make or Break a Habit? (For Students)</h2>

    <p>We all struggle with our habits, especially us students. No doubt about that. But did you know that we, as students, are actually more likely to succeed in improving our habits compared to adults with jobs and rigid routines? You might not realize it now — how playing video games all day, sleeping through class, or skipping meals is a bad idea. After all, we’re young and it feels like our time to ignore that giant 5-foot banner with <strong>DANGER</strong> written on it in <b> bold capital letters</b>.</p>

    <p>Yes, we’ve all heard those <b>mid</b> parents’ lectures about wasting time, but seriously — your habits will decide what you become. And sure, you might think of that one person you know (a neighbor, some actor, or YouTuber) who became successful despite being a total mess at first. But here’s the truth: those people changed. They sacrificed everything — their time, bad habits, distractions, even relationships — for the sake of their success. Nothing comes without effort.</p>

    <p>So, how can you <strong>change your habits</strong>? It’s simple — but simple doesn’t mean easy. You’ll have to work for it. The good thing is, habits tend to follow a few basic rules or, as I like to call them, <strong>laws</strong>. Here’s what you need to know:</p>
</section>

<section id="content" class="justify">
    <p><strong>Law #1: Load, Aim, and Shoot</strong><br>
    We all love to procrastinate, especially when it comes to things that can genuinely improve our lives. And nothing feels better than making an over-detailed plan you’ll never follow. I call this <strong>pseudo-planning</strong> — like creating a strategy so good it could get <em>Elon to Mars</em> in a week, but still somehow you don’t act on it.</p>

    <p>The fix? Clean up your mind <em>(and your room, please)</em> and try something called <strong>micro-tasking</strong>. It’s simple: break your tasks into small, manageable parts. Instead of saying, “I’ll study Physics for 3 hours,”<em>(and end up doing <b>1 to 3</b> questions in the whole 3 hour study session.)</em> say, “I’ll solve 5 Physics questions, then take a 5-minute break.” Repeat this. Small steps are always better than no steps.</p>

    <p><strong>Law #2: Make It Obvious and Easy</strong><br>
    One major reason we skip good habits is because they aren’t visible or easy to start. You’re more likely to eat chips if they’re on your table than a fruit hidden in the fridge. So, set up your environment to make <b>good habits obvious and bad habits hard</b>. Keep your books on your desk, put your phone in another room while studying, or leave your workout clothes by your bed. Make it so easy that it feels silly not to start.</p>

    <p><strong>Law #3: Reward Yourself (But Smartly)</strong><br>
    <b>Rewards</b> are what keep habits alive. But not mindless rewards like <em>hours of Instagram</em> <b>doom-scrolling</b>. Do something small and positive after completing a task — <b>like listening to one good song, going for a quick walk, or grabbing a healthy snack</b>. It gives your brain a reason to crave the habit again. The trick is to balance it: don’t let the reward become the distraction.</p>

    <p>So, there you have it. No magic formula, just three simple laws you can start using today. Start small, stay consistent, and before you know it, those tiny habits will shape the person you’re becoming.</p>
